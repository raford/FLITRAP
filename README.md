## What is FLITrap?

## How do I run FLYTrap on my machine?
There are two ways to run FLITrap on your machine: use a standalone version of FLITrap, or download all of the files needed to run FLITrap. We will show you how to run FLITrap for both of these ways.

### Standalone versions
We have made standalone versions of FLITrap available for the following machines:
* OSX 10.10 (Yosemite)

Standalone versions can be downloaded from [here.](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/zkm6gbizss5pf1u/AAC5nJ-rn-YrjmJE0s3dLsyca?dl=0)


### Download all of the files
In order to run FLITrap without downloading a standalone version of FLITrap, you will need to download the "master-flitrap" zip. This can be accomplished within this page by clicking the highlighted button in the screenshot below.



## Screenshots of FLITrap in action
Below is a screenshot of FLITrap being used to search for information about BDSC stock number 47708.

If you should happen to enter an invalid BDSC stock number, then you will see the following.

This work is supported in part by the NSF grant DUE-0926721 and NIH-NIMHD grant 5G12MD007592. I would like to thank the University of Texas at El Paso's [Undergraduate Participation in Bioinformatics Training (UPBiT)](http://www.bioinformatics.utep.edu/UPBiT/index.php) for giving me the opportunity to participate in bioinformatics research as an undergraduate majoring in statistics. Under the mentorship of Professors Ming-Ying Leung and Kyung-An Han, I was given what I feel is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn more about statistics, computer science, and biology---beyond what was offered in the courses required for my degree.
