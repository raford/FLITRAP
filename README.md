## Acknowledgements
This work is supported in part by the NSF grant DUE-0926721 and NIH-NIMHD grant 5G12MD007592. I would like to thank the University of Texas at El Paso's [Undergraduate Participation in Bioinformatics Training (UPBiT)](http://www.bioinformatics.utep.edu/UPBiT/index.php) for giving me the opportunity to participate in bioinformatics research as an undergraduate majoring in statistics. Under the mentorship of Professors Ming-Ying Leung and Kyung-An Han, I was given what I feel is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to learn more about statistics, computer science, and biology---beyond what was offered in the courses required for my degree.
